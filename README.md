# Telco Churn Analysis

## Overview
**Telco Churn Analysis** is a machine learning project that aims to analyze customer churn in the telecommunications sector. Using clustering, classification, and visualization techniques, this project provides insights into customer behavior and identifies factors contributing to churn. It enables businesses to devise strategies for customer retention and improve overall profitability.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding key trends and correlations in the dataset.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Clustering customers into distinct groups based on their behavior.
- **Churn Prediction**: Using machine learning models to predict the likelihood of customer churn.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representations like PCA-based scatter plots and the Elbow Method for cluster analysis.

## Key Techniques Used
- **Clustering**: K-Means algorithm to segment customers.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for visualizing clusters in 2D.
- **Classification Metrics**: Log Loss and other evaluation metrics to measure model performance.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Seaborn and Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and preprocessing.

## Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned the data by handling missing values.
   - Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler.
   - Encoded categorical variables (if present).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized trends in tenure, monthly charges, and total charges.
   - Analyzed churn distribution across various features.

3. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
   - Used K-Means to group customers.
   - Visualized clusters in 2D using PCA.

4. **Churn Prediction**:
   - Built machine learning models to predict churn probability.
   - Evaluated models using Log Loss.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Scatter plots for PCA components to visualize clusters.
   - Line plot for the Elbow Method to select the optimal number of clusters.

## Results and Insights
- Identified distinct customer segments based on tenure and total charges.
- Highlighted clusters with higher churn rates, enabling targeted retention strategies.
- Achieved a log loss of 0.5116, indicating a reasonably good prediction model.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telco-churn-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd telco-churn-analysis
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Telco_Customer_Churn.ipynb
   ```

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available and contains information about customers in the telecommunications industry, including:
- **Tenure**: Duration of the customer's relationship with the company.
- **Monthly Charges**: The amount billed monthly.
- **Total Charges**: The total amount billed to date.
- **Churn**: Indicates whether the customer has left the company.

## Visualizations
- **Elbow Method**: Used to determine the optimal number of clusters for customer segmentation.
- **PCA Scatter Plot**: Visualized customer clusters in two dimensions.
- **Churn Distribution**: Highlighted churn rates across different customer segments.

## Future Work
- Incorporate additional features for a deeper understanding of customer behavior.
- Experiment with advanced clustering techniques like DBSCAN or hierarchical clustering.
- Improve prediction accuracy with hyperparameter tuning and ensemble models.
